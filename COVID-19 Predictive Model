To create a final model for COVID-19 in the country of Zambia, I started off with data from 4/1/20 to 4/20/20 which indicated the number of people with confirmed 
COVID-19 cases as well as those who recovered and those who died from COVID-19. Using this data I was able to build a predictive model which showed the number of people who had confirmed 
COVID-19 cases as well as the number of people who recovered from and died from COVID-19 for the next 10 days. I was able to compare my model to actual data from the following 10 days
and analyzed why there were discrepencies between the model and the actual data. All of the analysis and predictions were done using Python and all of the graphs were generated using python
as well. Below are the graphs and models generated from my analysis:
